The state Congress leadership put pressure on the high command to bar party leaders from participating in the seminar. But I've decided to attend it since federalism is a burning issue for non-BJP-ruled states, including Kerala. I don't understand the logic behind the ban. Is the CPI(M) politically untouchable for the Congress at a time when the BJP is trying to throttle the non-BJP-ruled states, is violating the Constitution, and its government at the Centre is bypassing its obligations? The Congress is also a victim of the prevailing political situation.\",\n",

The 98-year-old leader has not missed a single party congress since the party's inception. Achuthanandan will miss the Kannur congress owing to ill-health. The 22nd party congress in Hyderabad in 2018 had honoured VS, the only founding member of the party alive. VS was inducted into the party politburo in 1985 at the 12th party congress held in Kolkata, and went on to be part of the PB for 24 long years.\",\n",

This was opposed by political bodies, calling them intolerant towards the meat shop owners, even though South Delhi Mayor Surian had reassured that the order was met with no friction.

A new Pakistan government will be formed most likely under Shehbaz, the younger brother of three-time former prime minister Nawaz Sharif, after Parliament reconvenes on Monday to vote for a new premier, a write up in the state-run Global Times said. \"Chinese and Pakistani analysts consider that the solid China-Pakistan relations will not be affected by the internal political change in Pakistan because to safeguard and develop the bilateral ties is the joint consensus of all parties and all groups in Pakistan,\" it said.',\n",

Yet the dance of democracy has begun in full swing with leaders of political parties boasting aloud that people are making a beeline to join their parties. As if that means anything at all. The political party merely provides a uniform for old timers to be seen in new colours. They are old wine in recycled bottles. At the end of the day we all know and have internalised the fact that – ‘Money Matters' and political parties are ready and willing to admit candidates they do not need to fund but who will fund their own election campaigns.\",\n",

Interior Minister Sheikh Rasheed and some other leaders are pressing the PM to resign from NA and provincial assemblies of Punjab and KP to build momentum for immediate fresh election. He said National Assembly members belonging to the PML-Q could not attend the parliamentary party meeting of the coalition partners held in Islamabad due to their hectic engagements in Lahore to muster support of Punjab Assembly members for Chaudhry Parvez Elahi, the joint candidate of the ruling coalition for the chief minister slot.',\n",
